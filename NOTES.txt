NOTES

note that sometimes things are separated by dashes,
while in other cases you want to separate with underscores
(directories are dashes, as is the name of the library)
(but the name as it appears in C function calls NEEDs to used underscores)

in ext/gem-name.c
	it must be
		Init_gem_name()
	rather than
		Init_gem-name()
	
	as the latter is not a valid C function name
